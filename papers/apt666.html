[+]             One Way to Recon Targets

[!] First, what is "recon"? is a short word to resume the term "Reconnaissance". Reconnaissance it's a 
important step in Pentest and Hacking work,  is where your plan of attack, and detect possible target's 
and vulnerabilities, and network information too.


[?] How it works? 

        [*] With some steps we can detect network ranges (CIDR's), possible alive target's, possible ASN 
	information, and the main, understand the anatomy of this network / enterprise / corp

[?] How i can start?
[*] For purposes, i can show an example: 
                [!] Just for purposes.

1 - DETECTING IP ADDRESS AND UNDERSTAND THE NETWORK (passive):
[+] TARGET: www.armada.mil.ec
        [*] First we can make just a ping on the host to see the IP Address:
                [+] On your terminal type: ping www.armada.mil.ec 
        [*] He returns: PING www.armada.mil.ec (192.188.196.95) 56(84) bytes of data. Where 192.188.196.95 is the IP Address
        [?] What we can make with just one ip address?
                [*] We can query in a WHOIS server to see what have about this in the database
                        [+] On your terminal type: whois 192.188.196.95
                        [+] Retrieved:

                                % and AS numbers.

                        [*] Note that, here is the e-mail of register of this domain, who probably register 
			    (Security CEDIA NREN) and IP Range information (192.188.196.0/24), and we can use this to 
			    enumerate many hosts on the network

                        [*] This is the network of the target, 192.188.196.0 -> 192.188.196.255 (256 hosts), remember this.


                        [!] Now we need to use some tools, i can show 5 of this:
                                [+] Amass (https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)
                                [+] Subfinder (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)
                                [+] Httpx (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)
                                [+] Nuclei (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
                                [+] Nmap (https://github.com/nmap/nmap)

2 - USING TOOLS TO ENUMERATE THE NETWORK AND FIND VULNERABILITIES (active):

        2.1 - SUBDOMAIN ENUMERATION AND APPLICATION ENUMERATION:

        [+] For first, we need to use the Amass tool
                [*] After install execute the tool with the commands:
                        [+] amass intel -cidr 192.188.196.0/24 -ip
                        [?] What the command means?
                                [+] The command "intel" it's for "intelligence" he use some search engines 
				    to make a strong search for CIDR's, specific domains, ASN's and etc...

                                [+] The -cidr flag means that we are using the method of search for CIDR's
                                [+] The CIDR (IP Range) that we found above
                                [+] The -ip flag means that we want see the IP Address of the host that he found
                        [+] This retrieve for us:
                                [+] inocar.mil.ec 192.188.196.2 (The host and respective ip address of him)

                        [+] For now, we need see if have more domains associated to this host, it's time to use subfinder
                        [+] subfinder -d inocar.mil.ec -silent -all -o list.txt
                                [+] The -d flag means that we are passing a single host to make a search for subdomains
                                [+] The -silent means that we don't want see banner
                                [+] The -all means that we want use all search engines that he can search
                                [+] -o list.txt means that we want save the output for a list called list.txt

                        [+] This retrieve for us:

                        [+] For this moment are intersing find some possible web servers to scan, for this, we can use httpx tool
                        [+] Command: httpx -l list.txt -o web.txt -silent
                                [+] -l means that we passing a list of hosts
                                [+] -o means that we want the output for an archive called web.txt
                                [+] -silent same of subfinder
                        [+] This retrieve for us:
                                https://mail.inocar.mil.ec
                                https://monitoreotsuk.inocar.mil.ec

                        [+] Ok, cool. 2 hosts are web servers, now we can pass to the next phase, the scan phase
         
        2.2 - FINDING VULNERABILITIES:
                [+] Now that we have 2 web servers running unknown applications, we can use the nuclei to find vulnerabilities for us
                [+] nuclei -t cves -l web.txt -silent
                        [+] -t cves means that we just need the CVE's templates, the CVE's templates can search 
			     vulnerabilities based on CVE's register, based in default behavior.

                [+] This retrieved:
                [CVE-2019-9670] [http] [critical] https://mail.inocar.mil.ec/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml
                [CVE-2019-12616] [http] [medium] https://monitoreotsuk.inocar.mil.ec/phpmyadmin/

                [+] Wow, a critical vulnerabilitie, a bit of this critical flaw above, it's a eXternal XML Entity + Server Side Request 
		    Forgery that results on Remote Code Execution on the target system

                [*] No, i don't forget you, nmap.
                [*] Nmap is a complex tool, i need more of 1 paper to explain the power of this tool, but for now, i can restrict 
		    the complex in one way to scan and determine other target, vulnerabilities, or simple recon with nmap

                [+] We can use nmap -sV -sC -Pn -v -oA output 192.188.196.0/24, i can explain all parameters and what is doing
                [+] -sV Scanning and getting banner of application (if possible)
                [+] -sC makes a scan using the default NSE scripts, like http-methods to see http methods allowed, and etc...
                [+] -Pn say to nmap don't check if alive, don't send a ping to target
                [+] -v it's just for verbose, and see what is happening in execution
                [+] -oA it's to output the scan in all formats, Grepable, XML and Nmap Default Output
                [+] finally, the ip range (CIDR) that we found above, in the first step


[!] With this, no, you can't hack the NASA and understand more complex networks, but it's a simple methodology that i use 
to understand from more simple to more complex networks, off course, cases and cases, in some cases i don't use some tools 
here, but it's a simple vision of targeting and enumerating network scopes

[+] Can be useless for you, that want understand how the network works and which hosts are based on this network.

[+] Hugs my friends, and alibaba.
